# PySeqX
Automating processes on the Illumina HiSeq X, based on code used for the HiSeq 2500.

**Background:**
The HiSeq is an instrument used for DNA sequencing. 
It was produced by Illumina, who have recently discontinued this device in favor of newer sequencing technology.

**Project Goal:**
PySeqX is an open-source code that controls the HiSeq X device and automates additional HiSeq X applications that go beyond initial sequencing applications. 
PySeq2500 is an open-souce code that already fulfills this purpose for the HiSeq 2500/2000 device, which are predecessors to the HiSeq X device. However, the HiSeq X differs from the HiSeq 2500 in a number of ways, hence the need for updated code.
